<p>In recent years, the idea that political elites do not respond to the poor has
gained ground. It is held by a diverse set of people, ranging from populist leaders,
yellow vest protesters to leftist academics. But is it true?</p>
<p>In 2014 Martin Gilens <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf">published</a> an influential approach to study this issue. He collected data from opinion polls on policy proposals. He then checked
whether the proposals were realized four years later. He found that the support of citizens around
the 90th percentile of the income distribution were much closer to policy outcomes than the support of folks around the 10th percentile.</p>
<p>More recently, this study design has been applied to Western European countries. For the Netherlands, Wouter Schakel has put together a data set that we will analyze below using R. His analysis can be found <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ser/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ser/mwz018/5475880">here</a>. In this blogpost his analysis is replicated using a bayesian workflow.</p>

<p>This is a rich data set. The key variables are <code>pass</code>, which records whether a proposal passed or not within four years, and <code>i05</code> up to <code>i95</code>, which tell us the percentage of support for a proposal per income group. The variable <code>i05</code> refers to the policy preferences of people at the 5th percentile of the income distribution, for example. Between surveys, different income categories are used, so that the relative position of an individual on the income scale is estimated. A granular analysis of every tenth percentile of incomes is therefore not advisable, but the measure would seem good enough for comparing rich folks to poor ones.</p>
<p>Original answers were on an ordinal scale that captured levels of support for a policy. Ordinal scales differ from poll to poll however, so that it makes sense that responses have been collapsed into the binary categories “in favor” and “against”. We also note that the measure does not reflect the overall support for a policy of the income group, because those who answered ‘neutral’ are left out of the analysis. What the <code>i10</code>, <code>i20</code>, … <code>i90</code> variables capture then is the percentage of support for a policy among those within an income group <em>that have an opinion</em>.</p>
<p>It has also been recorded whether people voted or not, so that <code>i10v</code> and <code>i10nv</code> are, respectively, voters and non voters at the 10th income percentile. The remaining variables are of lesser importance and will be described when they are used in the analysis.</p>

A possible mechanism for the influence of the rich on policy is the electoral process. The plot
below shows that voters and non voters generally think alike, but that there is some variation
that might shed light on this mechanism. A glance at the rectangles suggests that the pass probability of proposals is higher when voters support it than if non voters support it. In part 2 we try to see if this impression holds up.</p>

<p>The column <code>nocode</code> is removed. It records the reason why <code>pass</code> is missing, and is therefore redundant. The eight columns to its right register whether subjects voted or not, specified for three income groups and all incomes (hence eight columns). Finally, there are missing values for <code>pass</code> itself (debt will not play a role in the analysis), which are crucial for the analysis. As the data set is arranged by year, we note that voting is missing more often in earlier years, whereas pass is missing more often for later years. Data are not missing randomly, then.</p>
<p>To put a number on the missing data, we produce a numeric summary that tells us that there are 58 polls that lack information on whether subjects voted or not and 14 that lack info on <code>pass</code>.</p>

<p>Whether their voting behavior is recorded or not, the preferences of all subjects have

We note that if it was not recorded if a proposal was passed or not, high income people
tend to be more supportive compared to proposals for which the outcome was recorded. We
furthermore note that none of the proposals with a missing <code>pass</code> outcome was about spending.</p>

<p>With regard to information on income of subjects, we observe that no data are missing. This suggests that only polls that provided income data have been included in the sample. It is impossible to determine whether this has led to a bias in the selection of types of policy proposals.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-to-do-about-missing-data" class="section level3">
<h3>What to do about missing data</h3>
<p>Simply throwing away rows with missing data can seriously bias results. Even if values were
missing due to some random process (and it is hard to imagine what that would even look like),
throwing away data would increase the standard error, so that it is harder to generalize from
the data.</p>
<p>The proper way to proceed is to impute missing values. That is, to come up with estimates of missing values based on the data. To this end, simple imputations like taking the mean or the lowest value
of a variable heavily bias the data. Instead, one ought to fill in missing values with a regression
model. Better still is to not only model the uncertainty as the error term in a regression model,
but to also model the uncertainty in the parameters of the model. This approach is
know as multiple imputation. There are actually several values generated per empty cells and hence many data sets. In our case 5.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Schakel_imp &lt;- mice(Schakel, m = 5, print = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p>In a bayesian framework, these data sets will all generate posteriors from which samples are drawn
by software. These samples can subsequently be thrown together to form a so called posterior, which is a distribution that assigns probabilities to the quantity that we care about. This posterior will not just incorporate the error of the regression model that <code>mice</code> uses for the imputation, but also the uncertainty in the estimates of this model (for every parameter there are five estimates). Generating these posteriors will be part of the analysis, to which we turn next.</p>
</div>
