<p>In previous posts on the Grit study we saw that it was difficult to estimate the effect of the grit intervention on math scores, even though we have data from a large experiment involving thousands of children. The reason was that the assignment to the intervention and control groups was not randomized at the level of the individual but at the level of the school.</p>
<p>In this post we attempt to balance properties of kids in the study evenly across the groups with the help of BART, short for Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. These regression trees are a machine learning method in which explanatory variables (aka covariates) are cut at certain points so that values below the value are assigned one estimate of y (what we want to explain) and values above another. After a given number of cuts are made the process stops. The resulting estimate of y is subtracted from the actual value of y and the process is repeated for the residuals. In this way, many trees are built, so that there is a risk of overfitting: fitting the model to the sample data and not to the underlying data generating process.</p>
<p>In so called boosting algorithms, this problem is solved by limiting the depth of the trees (that is, the number of branching points per tree) and multiplying all trees by a small number, so that the impact of a tree that models twists and turn in the data and not the data generating process is limited. In BART, this problem is solved by setting priors for both the tree depth and the multiplier. In this way, if the signal is strong, the data can override the regularization we put on the model to prevent it from fitting noise.</p>
<p>We load the required packages and the data. This time we also load data from sample 1, which did not properly assign children to the control and intervention groups. We can now include this data however, because the flexible BART model allows us to control for confounders. The BART model is very good at these kinds of causal estimations, since it was one of the winners of a 2016 causal prediction tournament.</p>

<p>We furthermore use only those rows that contain no missing values. (Given more time we would impute missing values.) Unfortunately, BART cannot solve the problem of selecting variables that are relevant. We therefore first run the BART model on sample 2 with the variables specified by the researchers, as we did in the previous blog post.</p>
<p>Unlike regular machine learning trees, BART can estimate the effect of the intervention variable and calculate the uncertainty.</p>

<p>We note an estimated effect of <code>grit</code> of only 0.16 with a meaty uncertainty. Unlike the standard error in classical regression, the sd of the posterior does not necessarily describe a normal distribution. It make sense, therefore, to plot it.</p>

<p>We observe that there is probably a treatment effect, but that it is probably smaller than both in the original authorâ€™s study and our multilevel model with imputed values.</p>
<p>We can hope to reduce the uncertainty in our estimation by including more observations. We therefore add the observations from the first sample and run the same model.</p>

<p>Adding more observations has not only reduced uncertainty, but increased the estimated effect of the <code>grit</code> intervention to 0.25.</p>

<p>Even though there are samples from the posterior around zero, most are centered around 0.3, which is close to the original estimate of the authors based on sample 2.</p>
<p>Again, we note here the instability of the model given variable selection. Wealth is not perfectly balanced between the control and intervention groups for the combined data set of sample 1 and 2 either.</p>

<p>The estimate now drops again to about 0.14.</p>
<p>Finally, we return to the authorâ€™s variable selection and try to enhance our estimation of the causal impact of <code>grit</code> by excluding children who have extreme values for certain properties. For example, if a child in the intervention group would have an extremely high IQ, we may not be able to find a counterpart in the control group. Consequently, we cannot estimate what would have happened in an alternative universe where the high IQ child would not have undergone the grit training program. So we exclude an individual if there is no counterpart within half a standard deviation of the spread of a property.</p>
